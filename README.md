Senior Overview website project - Spring 2022 - HTML/CSS

This is a website meant to advertise a game concept of mine (made for a class for the Fall 2021 semester).
The site utilizes Bootstrap 5 and I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE.

For the mockups, I used templates (credits in images > shop-photos > img-sources.txt) and Adobe Photoshop.
