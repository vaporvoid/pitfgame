Senior Overview website project - Spring 2022 - HTML/CSS

Milestone map (as of week 2):
Website Marketing a Hypothetical Game
Overview
-	The goal for this project is to create an interactive HTML/CSS website.
-	The website will be built to be cohesive with fictional marketing material for a game
-	The game will not be created, though some advertising material will be to show proof of concept and aid in making the website theme
Stages
-	Research
o	Choosing an appropriate “game” to advertise
	Game chosen: Pumpkin in the Forest (using GDD from Narrative Design)
o	Looking at other game ad websites to get an idea of what pages should be on my website
	Ideal pages:
•	Home
•	Story
•	Features
o	Doodles of Pumpkin’s costumes with some text
•	Characters
o	Pumpkin, Toodles, & Enigma
•	About
•	“Connect”, “contact”, and legal jargon in footer
-	Assets
o	Creating marketing assets
	rundown of assets under Elements & Assets
o	Making a color palette consistent with the “game”/theme
-	Implementation
o	Implementing the marketing assets into the website
-	Organization
o	After pages have been created, I will do some user testing to make sure that the organization makes sense and meets user expectations.
Elements & Assets
-	Fictional marketing material for a game
o	Game cover art
o	Game banner
o	Art displaying “features” (costumes)
-	Color palette
o	Hex codes or image of palette
-	Used typefaces
Weekly Task List
-	Week 1:
o	initial milestone map
o	initial brainstorming
-	Week 2:
o	create site index / homepage (HTML)
o	pick a theme / color scheme
o	start the CSS
o	pick a hypothetical game to advertise
-	Week 3:
o	create wireframes for the homepage and subsequent pages
	on paper and maybe digitally if I have time/feel it may help
-	Week 4:
o	add more pages (barebones)
o	create menu connecting index + new pages
-	Week 5:
o	edit the CSS to be more consistent with the wireframes
o	begin filling pages with content
-	Week 6:

-	Week 8:
o	edit the CSS to be more consistent with the marketing content (typeface, palette(s))
o	fix any layout issues
-	Week 9:
o	work on getting each page properly formatted with CSS
o	further implementation of marketing content on each page
-	Week 10:
o	take a step back to check consistency with theme and tone
o	begin having others test the website, poke around and see that links work as intended and the menu is organized in a predictable way
-	Week 11:
o	see about potentially making more “game” mockups to display on the site if I am caught up
o	if I am not caught up, get caught up
-	Week 12:
o	look deeply into other websites with similar products/services and implement any major consistencies that the intended audience may appreciate (small stuff)
-	Week 13:
o	see about making the website more responsive (all devices)
-	Week 14:
o	final cosmetic and text additions and corrections
-	Week 15:
o	final user testing phase
o	implement any recommendations and fix any found errors
-	Final week
o	polish everything
o	finalize
Final Product
An interactive website focused on marketing a hypothetical game. It will have marketing material, multiple pages (5 planned), and a footer. The theme will be consistent, tie in with the marketing material, and visually coherent (ideally pleasing).
Assessment
By the end, I will have made a showcase of what I am capable of in terms of conceptualizing a website and making the necessary components for a thematically cohesive, interactive HTML/CSS website.
